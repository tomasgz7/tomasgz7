# 👋 Hi, I'm Tomas Guzman

I'm a **Web Developer** with **1 year of experience**, working at an agency and on various **freelance projects**, collaborating with clients from different sectors such as **theaters**, **small businesses**, and **gyms**.

I have a **strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, and hands-on experience with **React**, acquired through personal projects and self-directed learning.  
In addition to frontend development, I'm currently **learning Java** to expand my skills into **backend development**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming** and **Spring Boot** for building robust server-side applications.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a **Higher Technical Degree in Systems Analysis (IFTS Nº21)**.  
I’ve also completed **courses and bootcamps** in key technologies such as **React**, **Modern JavaScript**, and **Full Stack Development**, which have strengthened both my frontend and backend capabilities.
